    * [Library for radiative transfer – libRadtran](http://www.libradtran.org/doku.php) for cloud-radiation interaction studies; coding of two newly-implemented radiation solvers: the classic "δ-Eddington two-stream method with maximum-random overlap assumption for partial cloudiness" and its upgrade – the "Tripleclouds radiation scheme based on the core-shell model for convective clouds" for use in global weather and climate models
    * [National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Cloud Model (CM1)](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/people/bryan/cm1/) for tropical cyclone intensification experiments; implementation of a balanced tropical cyclone vortex as a new initialization option
    * Validation of the atmospheric component of global climate models using [NASA A-train satellite observations](https://atrain.nasa.gov/)
    * Regional numerical weather prediction model ALADIN – optimization and validation of a new model configuration at ECMWF High Performance Computing (HPC) facility
