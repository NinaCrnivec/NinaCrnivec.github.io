## Teaching Experience

* **Teaching assistant**, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich (2016 — 2018)<br/>
  * <ins>Lecture</ins>: **Clouds: Microphysics and Convection** (Meteorology master's study course, lecturers: Prof. Dr. Markus Rapp, Dr. Tobias Zinner)  
  * <ins>Content</ins>: The lecture covers cloud processes from the micro- to the meso-scale. The "Microphysics" part includes topics such as droplet formation, diffusional droplet growth, coalescence, precipitation, distinguishment between the warm, cold, and mixed-phase cloud microphysics, aerosol direct/indirect effects, thunderstorm electrification and lightning. The "Convection" part covers the convective instability criteria, generation and organization of convection (single cell, multicell, supercell), tornadoes, thunderstorm outflow, downdrafts, mesoscale convective systems.

## Theses Supervision
