## Teaching Experience

* **Teaching assistant**, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich (2016 — 2018)<br/>
  * <ins>Lecture</ins>: **Clouds: Microphysics and Convection** (Meteorology master's study course, lecturers: Prof. Dr. Markus Rapp, Dr. Tobias Zinner)  
  * <ins>Content</ins>: The lecture covers cloud processes from the micro- to the meso-scale. The "Microphysics" part includes topics such as droplet formation, diffusional droplet growth, coalescence, precipitation, distinguishment between the warm, cold, and mixed-phase cloud microphysics, aerosol direct/indirect effects, thunderstorm electrification and lightning. The "Convection" part covers the convective instability criteria, generation and organization of convection (single cell, multicell, supercell), tornadoes, thunderstorm outflow, downdrafts, mesoscale convective systems (squall lines, tropical cyclones).
  
* **Invited lecturer**, University of Ljubljana (2022)<br/>
  * <ins>Lecture</ins>: **Radiative transfer modeling in a cloudy atmosphere** (audience: bachelor and master students of Meteorology and Physics, host: Dr. Žiga Zaplotnik)
  * <ins>Content</ins>: The lecture covers basic principles of radiative transfer theory (absorption, scattering, emission), radiative heating rates in clear-sky versus cloudy atmosphere, three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiation modeling and Independent Column Approximation, two-stream methodology, traditional (plane-parallel) and state-of-the-art representation of subgrid cloud structure in radiation schemes of weather and climate models.

## Mentoring Experience

* **Co-supervisor of bachelor student** (together with Prof. Dr. Bernhard Mayer), Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich (2017)<br/>
  * <ins>Thesis title</ins>: _Modellierung von 3D solaren Erwärmungsraten in Abhängigkeit vom Aspektverhältnis der Wolken (Modelling of 3D solar heating rates as a function of cloud aspect ratio)_

* **Mentor, [Climatematch Academy: Computational Tools For Climate Science](https://academy.climatematch.io/courses/2023-computational-tools-for-climate-science)**, virtual summer academy for worldwide students (2023)<br/>
  * <ins>Role</ins>: Providing guidance to students on various issues such as professional development, research strategy, computational tools for Earth system science, technical and soft skills, effective collaboration and networking, principles of scientific integrity and inclusive work environment, science communication, bridging the gap between climate research and climate action, career advice for minority groups including women in science.<br/>

## Leadership Experience

* **Co-lead of the ["RESCCCUE – REminding Slovenian authorities Climate Change Crisis requires Urgent Effort"](https://www.emetsoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/oc2020_RESCCCUE_project-description.pdf) project team, awarded European Meteorological Society Outreach and Communication Award (2020)** <br/>

  * <ins>Role</ins>: Together with Dr. Žiga Zaplotnik, Dr. Lina Boljka and Dr. Aljoša Slameršak I brought together over 100 leading Slovenian scientists from various disciplines comprising meteorologists, climatologists, oceanographers, physicists, biologists, chemists, geographers, and others, to advance climate literacy and science-based climate policy making in my home country Slovenia.


* **Co-lead of the [World Climate Research Programme's Fresh Eyes on CMIP](https://wcrp-cmip.org/fresh-eyes-on-cmip/) Data Analysis working group** (Aug 2023 – present)<br/>

  * <ins>Role</ins>: Together with Dr. Joshua Dorrington (KIT, Germany) and Dr. Abdullah Al Fahad (NASA GSFC, USA) I'm currently leading a global team of early career researchers aiming to advance data analysis tools for the next phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). <em>Thus if you have encountered any issues or challenges when analyzing CMIP6/CMIP5 data, please reach out and share your concerns, so that we can strive for proper improvements in CMIP7.</em>
