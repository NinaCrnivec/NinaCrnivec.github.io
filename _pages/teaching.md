## Teaching Experience

* **Teaching assistant**, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich (2016 — 2018)<br/>
  * <ins>Lecture</ins>: **Clouds: Microphysics and Convection** (Meteorology master's study course, lecturers: Prof. Dr. Markus Rapp, Dr. Tobias Zinner)  
  * <ins>Content</ins>: The lecture covers cloud processes from the micro- to the meso-scale. The "Microphysics" part includes topics such as droplet formation, diffusional droplet growth, coalescence, precipitation, distinguishment between the warm, cold, and mixed-phase cloud microphysics, aerosol direct/indirect effects, thunderstorm electrification and lightning. The "Convection" part covers the convective instability criteria, generation and organization of convection (single cell, multicell, supercell), tornadoes, thunderstorm outflow, downdrafts, mesoscale convective systems (squall lines).
  
* **Invited lecturer**, University of Ljubljana (2022)<br/>
  * <ins>Lecture</ins>: **Radiative transfer modeling problem in a cloudy atmosphere** (audience: bachelor and master students of Meteorology and Physics, host: Dr. Žiga Zaplotnik)
  * <ins>Content</ins>: The lecture covers basic principles of radiative transfer theory (absorption, scattering, emission), radiative heating rates in clear-sky versus cloudy atmosphere, three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiation modeling and Independent Column Approximation, two-stream methodology, traditional (plane-parallel) and state-of-the-art representation of subgrid cloud structure in radiation schemes of weather and climate models.
