**Constraining models' cumulus and stratocumulus cloud feedbacks in the tropics using satellite observations** 

Low-cloud feedbacks represent the largest source of uncertainty in climate projections on the centennial scale. In my postdoctoral research I employ satellite observations to constrain low-cloud feedbacks in a suite of CMIP5 and CMIP6 climate models. The principal aim of this research is to separately evaluate feedbacks related to the two main low cloud categories: shallow cumulus and stratocumulus. To accomplish this task I utilize the [Cumulus And Stratocumuls CloudSat-CALIPSO Dataset (CASCCAD)](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/clouds/casccad/) recently created by Cesana et al. (2019).<br/>

**Tropical cyclone intensification & tropical climatology**

Tropical cyclones (TCs) are among nature's most powerful phenomena, yet accurate forecasts of TC intensity change still remain a challenge. To that end, the main goal of my research is to improve physical understanding of TC intensification. I employ numerical modelling of TCs in an idealized framework using open-source [NCAR Cloud Model (CM1)](http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/people/bryan/cm1/). In particular, I investigated how various environmental factors, such as latitude and sea surface temperature, affect the early period of TC intensification, including that of rapid intensification ([Črnivec et al., 2016](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.2752)). For this purpose, I first implemented a TC-like vortex as a new initialization option into the CM1 model. The subsequent numerical experiments relate to the prototype problem for TC intensification assuming an f-plane and employ the Dunion moist tropical sounding (Dunion, 2011) to characterize the background thermodynamic TC environment, which is widely used in idealized TC modelling. The Dunion sounding, however, is based on the observations in the Carribean and the question that we addressed in a follow-up study ([Črnivec and Smith, 2016](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.4687)) is to what extent is the Dunion sounding representative to TC environments in other parts of the globe. I therefore derived mean radiosonde soundings for the Australian monsoon/cyclone season (for the Willis Island, Darwin and Weipa stations), documented their various characteristics and finally examined how they control vortex amplification. The arguments were based on an axisymmetric perspective, invoking the classical axisymmetric spin‐up mechanism. As an upgrade, we have recently investigated the relevance of non-axisymmetric features on the intensification process ([Montgomery et al., 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3837)).
