I am a PhD student of Meteorology at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich working on [Waves To Weather](https://w2w.meteo.physik.uni-muenchen.de/) [project B4](https://w2w.meteo.physik.uni-muenchen.de/research_areas/phase1/b4/index.html) "*Radiative heating and cooling at cloud scale and its impact on dynamics*".

Working group: Remote sensing and radiative transfer (Prof. Dr. Bernhard Mayer)

Research Interests
------
- Cloud-radiation interaction

- Shallow cumulus clouds

- Tropical cyclone intensification

Research Highlights
------
Quantifying the bias of radiative heating rates in numerical weather prediction models for shallow cumulus clouds. [Read more](https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/19/8083/2019/)
