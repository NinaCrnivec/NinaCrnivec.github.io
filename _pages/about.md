I am a meteorologist currently working on WMO [SEE-MHEWS](https://public.wmo.int/en/projects/see-mhews-a) project at Slovenian Environment Agency. I completed my PhD at Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, where my research focused on cloud-radiation interaction to advance its representation in weather and climate models. Prior to that I investigated tropical cyclone intensification.

Besides classic research work, I enjoy various science outreach activities and I am actively engaged in communicating climate change on board of the [RESCCCUE](https://www.emetsoc.org/oc2020-for-rescccue-slovenia/) team.

In case you have interest and want to collaborate on any of these topics, I would be happy to get in touch!
