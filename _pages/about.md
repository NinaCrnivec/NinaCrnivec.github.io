I am currently a [postdoctoral research scientist](https://ccsr.columbia.edu/people/nina-crnivec) working with [Dr. Gr√©gory Cesana](https://ccsr.columbia.edu/people/gregory-cesana) at Columbia University/NASA GISS, where I aim to better understand clouds and the role they play in the climate system. My research has mainly focused on clouds, radiative transfer, their interplay as well as on dynamics of larger cloud systems such as tropical cyclones.

Besides classic research work, I enjoy various science outreach activities and I am actively engaged in communicating climate change on board of the [RESCCCUE](https://www.emetsoc.org/oc2020-for-rescccue-slovenia/) team.

In case you have interest and want to collaborate on any of these topics, I would be happy to get in touch!
